This is my portfolio website where i decide to showcase my web development projects. I started this website
in January 2019 while attending the Code Louisville programme in Kentucky. Thank you very much to all the
staff and mentors at Code Louisville for giving us the opportunity to learn Front End development.I am hoping
to attend the Back End Development also. I have used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build this website. Thanks
to treehouse also for their great video tutorials also. For any feedbacks or suggestions please email me at 
aeojobe@gmail.com or call me at 502-202-7273. Thank you.
